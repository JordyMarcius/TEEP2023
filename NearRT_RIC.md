# I. Near-RT RIC
## I.I. Definition
**Near-Real-Time RIC** is a logical function that ==enables near-real-time control and optimization== of O-RAN elements and resources through **xApps**. Near-Real-Time RIC operates on a time scale between **10 ms and 1 s**.

- **xApps:** 
    - An application designed to run on near-RT RIC (consist of one or more microservices) that identifies data to consume and provide.
    - Perform the data monitoring and parameter adjustment of RAN functions.
    - Divided into two main parts, i.e. ==image== and ==descriptor==.

- **Messaging Infrastructure:**
    - Deal with message interaction in Near-RT RIC
    - Provides APIs for sending & receiving messages and provides routing & robustness to avoid data loss.
    - Low latency and point to point

- **Conflict Mitigation:**
    -  This component will mitigate possible ==overlapping== or ==conflicting== request from different xApps.
    -  **Direct conflicts:** two or more xApps request different settings to control the target.
    -  **Indirect conflicts:** two or more parameters that affect the same target (e.g. antenna angle and measurement deviation).

- **xApp Subscription Manager:**
    - Manages subscriptions from the xApps to the E2 nodes.
    - Merges subscriptions from different xApps into a single subscription

- **Management Services:**
    - Life cycle management of xApp
    - FCAPS management of Near-RT RIC

- **Security:**
    - Prevent malicious third-party xApps from abusing radio network information.
    
- **Shared Data Layer:**
    - An API that used to store or show any data to database.
